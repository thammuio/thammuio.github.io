<p>This Helps on how to setup SSL and Kerberos for Kafka - Cloudera.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Kafka</h2>

<p>A fast, scalable, fault-tolerant messaging system</p>

<p>Apacheâ„¢ Kafka is a fast, scalable, durable, and fault-tolerant publish-subscribe messaging system. Kafka is often used in place of traditional message brokers like JMS and AMQP because of its higher throughput, reliability and replication.</p>

<p>Kafka works in combination with Apache Storm, Apache HBase and Apache Spark for real-time analysis and rendering of streaming data. Kafka can message geospatial data from a fleet of long-haul trucks or sensor data from heating and cooling equipment in office buildings. Whatever the industry or use case, Kafka brokers massive message streams for low-latency analysis in Enterprise Apache Hadoop.</p>
