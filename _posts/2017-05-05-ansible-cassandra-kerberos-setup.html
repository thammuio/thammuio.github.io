<p>This Ansible Playbook helps setting up Kerberizing Datastax Cassandra Clusters.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Ansible</h2>

<p>Ansible is a radically simple IT automation system. It handles configuration-management, application deployment, cloud provisioning, ad-hoc task-execution, and multinode orchestration - including trivializing things like zero downtime rolling updates with load balancers.</p>

<p>Read the documentation and more at <a href="https://ansible.com/">https://ansible.com/</a></p>

<p>You can find installation instructions here for a variety of platforms. Most users should probably install a released version of Ansible from pip, a package manager or our release repository. Officially supported builds of Ansible are also available. Some power users run directly from the development branch - while significant efforts are made to ensure that devel is reasonably stable, you're more likely to encounter breaking changes when running Ansible this way.</p>


<h2 class="section-heading">Design Principles</h2>

<blockquote class="blockquote"></blockquote>
<p>
	Have a dead simple setup process and a minimal learning curve
	Manage machines very quickly and in parallel
	Avoid custom-agents and additional open ports, be agentless by leveraging the existing SSH daemon
	Describe infrastructure in a language that is both machine and human friendly
	Focus on security and easy auditability/review/rewriting of content
	Manage new remote machines instantly, without bootstrapping any software
	Allow module development in any dynamic language, not just Python
	Be usable as non-root
	Be the easiest IT automation system to use, ever.
